    <p class = "subheader" id ="about">About Us</p>
    <p class =  "text" id = "abouttext">Group 10 of SPIT FE is attempting to find solutions regarding one of the greatest problems in the Mumbai Metropolitan District, Rise in Temperature. We are a group of 12 people, that surveyed people, interviewed professionals from different institutions and conducted our own research to provide our community with effective solutuions to this everpresent issue. We also created posters and shared them offline as well as online to educate the community on these problems and their solution.</p>
    <p class = "subheader" id = "location">Location Of Project</p>    
    <p class =  "text" id = "locationtext">Our area of work is the Mumbai Metropolitan District, a peninsula stretching from Mahim and Sion in the north to Malabar Hill and Navy Nagar to the south. It is the heart of second largest city in India and is a Cultural and Economic Juggernaut, housing 30 lakh people of various ethnicities and religions and being one of the most productive regions in India, rivaling many of its contempories in developed nations.Consequently it is also a region of sharp economic contrast, from the slums of dharavi to the ultra rich regions in the Malabar hills and Backbay, hailed as the most expensive region for real estate in India. As a result, we find a huge variety of problems, which were brainstormed and placed within a survey. After the results of said Survey were analysed, we choose the topic "Rise in Temperature and its Impact in Mumbai" a large topic encompassing various things and affecting every single resident, from the daily wage worker on a contruction site in Dadar to the Executive of a multinational Company in Lower Parel.</p>
