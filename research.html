        <p class="subheader" id="impact">Impact of excessive heat</p>
        <p class="text" id="problemstext1">Economic Impact: Heat impacts several industries that directly or indirectly
                affects the economy. In agriculture,High temperatures negatively impact crop yields, reducing exports
                and increasing inflation. This scenario can further strain the Consumer Price Index
                (CPI). Heat-related problems in construction
                affect labor efficiency and project timelines, escalating costs, And lastly, Increased power demand
                during heatwaves leads to higher coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate
                change and creating a vicious cycle.</p>
        <p class="text" id="problemstext2">Medical Impact: Temperature-sensitive medical equipment and vaccines face the
                risk of damage or loss during heatwaves, leading to economic setbacks in the healthcare sector. Rising
                temperatures affect rainfall patterns, leading to more frequent floods, especially in coastal cities
                like Mumbai. Flooding results in the dislocation of populations and increases mortality rates. The
                combination of frequent disease outbreaks and heat stress weakens the immune system, increasing
                susceptibility to diseases and healthcare costs. Heatstroke is a direct consequence of extreme heat. Its
                likelihood increases with increase in temperature. They can be considered a silent killer as they give
                rise to many other life threatening ailments such as heart attack, which may then instead be considered
                as the cause of death sometimes.
