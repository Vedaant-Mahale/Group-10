        <p class="subheader" id="impact">Impact of excessive heat</p>
        <p class="text" id="problemstext1">Economic Impact: Heat impacts several industries that directly or indirectly
                affects the economy. In agriculture,High temperatures negatively impact crop yields, reducing exports
                and increasing inflation. This scenario can further strain the Consumer Price Index
                (CPI). Heat-related problems in construction
                affect labor efficiency and project timelines, escalating costs, And lastly, Increased power demand
                during heatwaves leads to higher coal consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbating climate
                change and creating a vicious cycle.</p>
        <p class="text" id="problemstext2">Medical Impact: Temperature-sensitive medical equipment and vaccines face the
                risk of damage or loss during heatwaves, leading to economic setbacks in the healthcare sector. Rising
                temperatures affect rainfall patterns, leading to more frequent floods, especially in coastal cities
                like Mumbai. Flooding results in the dislocation of populations and increases mortality rates. The
                combination of frequent disease outbreaks and heat stress weakens the immune system, increasing
                susceptibility to diseases and healthcare costs. Heatstroke is a direct consequence of extreme heat. Its
                likelihood increases with increase in temperature. They can be considered a silent killer as they give
                rise to many other life threatening ailments such as heart attack, which may then instead be considered
                as the cause of death sometimes.

        <p class="subheader" id="solutions">Solutions to Excessive Heat</p>
        <p class="text" id="solutionstext">Infrastructure Upgrades: avoid large amounts of glass (like office buildings)
                as this both traps heat in and reflects the sunlight onto streets, thereby increasing temperature
                overall. Use RCC over cement or steel supports, which helps with heat dissipation.Modern cooling
                strategies include both passive and active methods. Taking advantage of Mumbaiâ€™s sea breeze by
                positioning windows to align with prevailing winds can enhance cooling, especially near the Arabian Sea.
                Painting buildings white or using radiative cooling paint can also help. Radiative cooling paints, such
                as those developed by JNCASR, reflect more sunlight and cool surfaces by up to 10 degrees
                Celsius. Additionally, increasing green cover on rooftops and walls can provide shade and improve air
                quality. Expanding tree cover on main roads and using concrete instead of asphalt can further reduce
                temperatures.
        </p>
        <p class="text" id="solutionstext2">Use of Trees: Trees help is us in 2 main ways, the more conventional
                method is soaking up greenhouse gas emissions, as well as direct cooling effect whose effect is directly
                related
                to the amount of density of trees. Plants provide direct cooling in two major ways. Plants are effective
                at
                providing shade due to the presence of the huge surface area of leaves that are filled with chlorophyll
                designed
                to absorb light and use it for photosynthesis. Trees also provide tremendous amounts of cooling with the
                help
                transpiration, that is the evaporation of water. This happens through microscopic holes called stomata.
                Since
                evaporation of water is an endothermic process, it absorbs a lot of heat from the surroundings. An
                individual
                tree can transpire hundreds of liters of water per day. For every 100 liters of water transpired, the
                tree then
                cools by 70 kWh, which is, comparable to a large air conditioning unit running for upto 12 hours.</p>

        <p class="text" id="solutionstext2">Public Transport: Adding more buses and trains to reduce
                overcrowding, implementing better scheduling systems and real-time tracking to ensure timely services,
                investing in better roads, stations, and maintenance facilities, installing CCTV cameras, deploying
                security personnel, and promoting safety awareness, ensuring that all vehicles and stations are
                accessible to people with disabilities, using data analytics to plan more efficient routes and reduce
                travel times, regular cleaning and maintenance of vehicles and stations and extending services to
                underserved areas is some of the few things BEST could do to improve bus transport. New modes of
                transport can also be used alongside busses such as metro rails that can not only cut down on
                overcrowding in local trains but also cut down on highway traffic as a cheap and comfortable alternative
                to cars
